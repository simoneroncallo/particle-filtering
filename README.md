# Particle filtering

This repository contains a Python simulation of a particle filter, implemented through sequential importance resampling. The simulation code can be found in `main.py`. The class Particle as well as the state-space and the observation models are implemented in `particlefilter.py`. Finally, `animation.py` generates a GIF animation of the filter evolution.
